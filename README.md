From the ground up, this project has been a deep dive into the intricacies of database design, management, and optimization. Here's a glimpse of what the project entailed:

🔹 ERD and Logical Diagram Design: The first step was to design the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and logical diagram, laying a solid foundation for our database. This step was critical in understanding the relationships between various entities such as students, courses, instructors, and departments.

🔹 SQL Scripts for Database Construction: With the design in place, I crafted SQL scripts to create tables that are the backbone of this database. Each table was carefully designed to ensure data integrity and facilitate smooth data retrieval.

🔹 Advanced Database Features: Going beyond the basics, I implemented triggers, procedures, and functions to automate and streamline operations within the database. These elements are crucial for maintaining data consistency and enforcing business rules.

🔹 Oracle Data Pump and Bash Scripting for Backups: Recognizing the importance of data security and recovery, I utilized Oracle Data Pump in combination with Bash scripting to create a reliable backup system. This setup ensures that the university's data is safely backed up, with the ability to restore it seamlessly when needed.

🛠️ Technologies Used: Oracle Database, SQL, Bash Scripting
